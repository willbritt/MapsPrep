    <h2> Mistakes that People Often Make When Creating Visualizations With Maps </h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li> Ebbinghaus Illusion </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Definition: Even if objects on a proportional symbol map are
             correctly sized, readers won't estimate their relative sizes well.
          </li>
          <li> Maps are priceless at offering an overview of your data, but
            they do not enable very accurate judgements.
          </li>
          <li> Ex: If you surround two circles of the same size with larger or
            smaller circles, your perception of their size will change.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Choosing the Best Projection </li>
        <ul>
          <li> No map can be conformal and equal-area simultaneously. As a result,
            designers must find the appropiate balance between the two. Being
            able to preserve continental shapes and preserve area ratios are
            essential in  creating a visualization with a map. As three
            of the following elements: shape, area, angles, distance, and
            direction, will be sacrificed (distorted) whenever you project a
            globe onto a flat surface.
          </li>
          <li> Larger region maps should focus on preserving area ratios more
            while smaller region maps should focus on preserving continental
            shapes and angles.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
